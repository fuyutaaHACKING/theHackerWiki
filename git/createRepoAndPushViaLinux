GitHub password access for git via linux has been removed. Create a token to access to your account: https://github.com/settings/tokens
To use the token, just type it/paste it in when you'll have to push and github will ask your password. You give the token, GitHub will take it as password.

You need to have an already existing repository.

git init
git add .
git commit -m "commit description"
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME_HERE/REPOSITORY_NAME_HERE.git
git push -u origin master


PUSH CODE

git add .
git commit -m "message for the commit"
git remote add origin https://url-of-github-repo
git push origin master

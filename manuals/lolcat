NAME
       lolcat - rainbow coloring effect for text console display

SYNOPSIS
       lolcat [options] [files] ...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the lolcat command.

       lolcat is a program that concatenates files, or standard input, to standard output (like the generic cat),
       and adds rainbow coloring to it.

OPTIONS
       -p X, --spread=X
              Inclination of the rainbow stripes
              (character widths per line hight; high values (>1000) give almost  horizonal  stripes,  low  values
              (0.1) almost vertical ones; default: 3.0).

       -F X, --freq=X
              Frequency of the rainbow effect.
              (low values around 0.0001 give almost monochromous screens; default: 0.1).

       -S X, --seed=X
              Initial value for the random number generator; 0 means automatic.
              (default: 0).

       -a, --animate
              Fade every line through an animation before printing the next one.

       -d X, --duration=X
              Duration of the animation.
              (number of steps before showing next line; default: 12)

       -s X, --speed=X
              Speed of the animation.
              (frame rate, ie. number of steps per second; default: 20)

       -i, --invert
              Inverts the background and foreground colors.

       -t, --truecolor
              Enables 24-bit truecolor mode.

       -f, --force
              Force color even when stdout is not a tty.

       -v, --version
              Shows lolcat version.

       -h, --help
              Shows options summary.

EXAMPLES
       Typical combinations of lolcat include other programs that generate text:
       Large colorful words can be written like this:

              echo "KTHXBAI" | toilet | lolcat

       Cows are popular, come in all colors, and tell random epigrams:

              fortune | cowsay | lolcat -a

PROXYCHAINS4(1)                              General Commands Manual                              PROXYCHAINS4(1)

NAME
       proxychains4 - redirect connections through proxy servers

SYNOPSIS
       proxychains4 --help
       proxychains4 [ -f configfile.conf ] <program>

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  forces  any  tcp  connection made by any given tcp client to follow through proxy (or proxy
       chain). It is a kind of proxifier.

       It acts like sockscap / premeo / eborder driver (intercepts TCP calls).

       This version (v4) supports SOCKS4, SOCKS5 and HTTP CONNECT proxy servers.  Auth-types: socks - "user/pass"
       , http - "basic".

   When to use it?
       1)  When the only way to get "outside" from your LAN is through proxy server.

       2)  When you are behind restrictive firewall which filters outgoing connections to some ports.

       3)  When you want to use two (or more) proxies in chain:
           like: your_host <--> proxy1 <--> proxy2 <--> target_host

       4)  When you want to "proxify" some programs with no proxy support built-in (like telnet).

       5)  When you don't want to pay for eBorder / premeo socks driver :)

   Some cool features:
       •   This program can mix different proxy types in the same chain. For instance:

           your_host <-->socks5 <--> http <--> socks4 <--> http <--> target_host

       •   Different chaining options are supported. For instance:

           •   take random proxy from the list

           •   chain proxies in exact order

           •   chain proxies in dynamic order (smart exclude dead proxies from chain)

       •   You  can  use  it  with  any  TCP  client application, even network scanners.  Yes, yes - you can make
           portscan via  proxy  (or  chained  proxies)  for  example  with  Nmap  scanner  by  fyodor  (www.inse‐
           cure.org/nmap).

           proxychains nmap -sT -PO -p 80 -iR  (find some webservers through proxy)

       NOTE: to run suid/sgid programs(like ssh) through proxychains you have to be root

FILES
       proxychains looks for config file in following order:

              file  listed  in  environment variable PROXYCHAINS_CONF_FILE or provided as a -f argument to proxy‐
              chains script or binary.

              ./proxychains.conf

              $(HOME)/.proxychains/proxychains.conf

              /etc/proxychains.conf

              /etc/proxychains4.conf

       More information is provided in /etc/proxychains4.conf file.

EXAMPLES
       To run this program the standard way type:
              proxychains telnet targethost.com

       In this example, it will run telnet through proxy(or chained proxies) specified by proxychains.conf.

       To run this program with custom configuration file:
              proxychains -f /etc/proxychains-other.conf telnet targethost2.com

       In this example, it will use a different configuration file as specified  to  connect  to  targethost2.com
       host.
